# Features
Information about and explanation of features are _Coming Soonâ„¢_  
![USBSID-Pico](images/pcbv0.2.png)
#### SID Playing
USBSID-Pico supports various ways of playing SID files.  
Out-of-the box playing is supported by using [Deepsid by Chordian](https://deepsid.chordian.net)  
by selecting `WebUSB (Hermit)` as player in the pulldown menu or  
by selecting `ASID (MIDI)` as player in the pulldown menu.  
[SidBerry](https://github.com/LouDnl/SidBerry) is a command line SID file player for Linux with up to 4 SIDs supported.  
Unofficial support is added to a fork of [Vice](https://github.com/LouDnl/Vice-USBSID), up to 3 SIDs are supported in vsid and up to 4 in xs64.  
Unofficial support is added to a fork of [RetroDebugger](https://github.com/LouDnl/RetroDebugger), up to 4 SIDs are supported.
##### C64 Music trackers
When using Vice or RetroDebugger you can freely use applications like [SID-Wizard](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sid-wizard/) for music creation.
#### Midi
USBSID-Pico acts as Midi device and supports basic Midi in ~ note that Midi is still in development and in Beta phase.  
This means that no support is available here at this time, please visit the Discord for more information.

### Test and config your board
I have set up a small test player using Hermit's JsSID implementation (borrowed from Deepsid).  
You can test (and config) your board with WebUSB and ASID here: [USBSID](https://usbsid.loudai.nl/index.html?player=webusb).  
If needed you can change your SID count configuration after selecting WebUSB.
#### Debug functions
For testing purposes only you can use the debug functions available on the [USBSID Debug](https://usbsid.loudai.nl/index.html?player=webusb&debug=usbsidpico) site.
### Supported platforms
_In development_  
Linux: Vice, RetroDebugger, SidBerry, JSidplay2, USB Midi, ASID (in webbrowser) SID Play  
Windows: Vice  
Windows/Android: USB Midi, ASID (in webbrowser) SID Play

# Firmware
See the [firmware changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on what's changed and previous releases.
### Firmware versions
Use `usbsidpico.uf2` for Pico1 regular green rp2040 Pico boards.  
Use `usbsidpico-rgb.uf2` for Pico1 black clone rp2040 Pico boards with RGB LED onboard.  
Use `usbsidpico_w.uf2` for PicoW regular green rp2040 PicoW boards.  
Use `usbsidpico2.uf2` for Pico2 regular green rp2350 Pico2 boards.  
**WARNING!** Do _NOT_ use the RGB firmware for any of the (non black) rp2040 or rp2350 Pico boards that do not contain an RGB LED.
### How to flash
A Raspberry Pi Pico board is incredibly easy to flash, as it comes with a built in bootloader for flashing new firmwares in the `uf2` format. 
In order to flash a new firmware to your USBSID-Pico you will need to put the Pico into bootloader mode. This can be done in 2 ways:
1. While the Pico is seated on the USBSID-Pico board and with the USB cable plugged into your computer and the Pico do the following:
	- Press and hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico.
	- Press and release the `RST` button on the USBSID-Pico board.
	- Now release the `BOOTSEL` button.
	- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2`.
	- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this folder.
	- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.
2. When flashing a Pico that is not seated on the board do the following:
	- Plug in the USB cable to your Pico and not into your computer.
	- While holding the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico plugin the other end of the USB cable into your computer.
	- Now release the `BOOTSEL` button.
	- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2`.
	- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this folder.
	- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.
### Firmware features
The firmware is still in development so features might change, be added or removed.
- By default both sockets are enabled and the configuration is set to 2 SID's.
- Custom CDC protocol for playing SID files or usage with emulators
- WebUSB support using the same CDC protocol for WebUSB supporting players
- Midi (in) ASID support (heavily inspired by multiple sources)
  - Play SID files in your (midi supporting) browser via [Deepsid](https://deepsid.chordian.net/) by Chordian
  - Play SID files in your (midi supporting) browser via [IneSID](https://inesid.fazibear.me/) by Fazibear
- Midi device support over USB
  - Use your USBSID-Pico as Synth with your Midi controller
- Two SID sockets with up to 4 SID's (e.g. SKPico) supported
  - Socket one address range $00 ~ $3F (default $00 ~ $1F)
  - Socket two address range $20 ~ $7F (default $20 ~ $3F)
  - Configurable (platform independent (Linux/Windows) tool still in development)
- Onboard LED acts as VU meter calculated by the voices of SID1 (Pico & Pico2 only)
- Onboard RGB LED acts as second VU meter calculated by the voices of SID1 (default)
  - Requires Black Pico clone board with RGB LED onboard!
  - SID voices to use for calculation can be changed in config
- Uses the [TinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) stack
### ISSUES that need addressing (Any help is welcome)
* Digiplay does not work like it should. This is a driver issue (client side).
  At one point I had this working with Async LIBUSB but forgot to backup it, DOH!  
  See the [discussion](https://github.com/LouDnl/USBSID-Pico/discussions/1) about this.
### Building
You can build the firmware using the Pico SDK 2.0.0 and TinyUSB from it's Github repo, not the one included in the SDK!

# Hardware
### Where to buy
#### Licensed resellers
[Run Stop Re-Store](https://www.runstoprestore.nl) at [Retro8BITshop](https://www.retro8bitshop.com) is the first reseller to sell licensed USBSID-Pico boards.  
Click [this link](https://www.retro8bitshop.com/product/usbsid-pico-by-loud/) to go to their product page
#### PCBWay
At a minimum of 5 bare or assembled boards it is also possible to purchase at [PCBWay here](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/USBSID_Pico_c99c9748.html).  
#### Me (while I still have boards)
While still available you can purchase assembled boards minus Pico from me - send me a message on any of my socials.  

### Schematic and BOM
If you want and are up to it you can create your own development board by using the provided [schematic](resources/v1.0-schematic.pdf) and [interactive BOM](https://loudnl.github.io/).
### PCB Features ~ v1.0
- Supports all MOS SID chips e.g. MOS6581, MOS6582 & MOS8580

  - 12v or 9v stepup for clean VDD to both SID chips
    - 12v/9v jumper, defautls to 12v ~ inspired by [SIDBlaster-Nano](https://codeberg.org/CBMretro/SIDBlaster-USB_Nano) design
- Audio out filter as in the [C64 schematics](https://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/computers/c64/250469-rev.A-right.gif)
  - With optional 6581 resistor, solder the 6581 (mislabeled 8580!) jumper pad in each audio circuit for this.
- Audio jumper
  - SID1 audio left & right
  - SID1 audio left & SID2 audio right
- Optional EXT-IN pulldown resistor as filter bypass to reduce filter noise for Digiplay on 8580 SID's

# Disclaimer
I do this stuff in my free time for my enjoyment. Since I like to share my joy in creating this with everyone I try my best to provide a working PCB and Firmware. I am in no way an electronics engineer and can give __no guarantee__ that this stuff does not break or damage your hardware, computer, phone, or whatever you try to hook it up to. Be sure to take great care when inserting any real MOS SID chips into the board. While everything has been tested with real chips, this is in no way a guarantee that nothing could go wrong. Use of this board and firmware at your own risk! I am in no way responsible for your damaged hardware. That being said, have fun!
