== Firmware types
image:images/firmware/logo-v1.0.jpg[Title=PCB logo v1.0]
image:images/firmware/logo-v1.3.jpg[Title=PCB logo v1.3] +
Each PCB revision is the firmware designator, please check your PCB revision, this is under the MOS logo and next to *USBSID-Pico* on your PCB. +
Firmware filenames contain the PCB revision number e.g. `usbsidpico-rgb-v1.X.uf2` is for PCB revision `v1.0` and for use with a black clone Pico containing an RGB LED.

== Firmware naming
Below are the filenames used for each Pico and board type, take great care in selecting the correct file for you Pico! +
**WARNING!** Do _NOT_ use the **RGB** firmware for any of the (non black) rp2040 or (non black) rp2350 Pico boards that do not contain an RGB LED, this can break your Pico! +

=== Board revision
The 1.X in each filename equals for the PCB revision as mentioned under firmware types. Don't worry if you flash a firmware for the incorrect PCB revision, this causes no harm. +

=== Firmwares for the rp2040 Pico1
Firmware naming suited for the pico 1 always start with `usbsidpico-` +
`usbsidpico-v1.X.uf2` for regular green rp2040 Pico boards. +
`usbsidpico-rgb-v1.X.uf2` for black clone rp2040 Pico boards with RGB LED onboard. +
`usbsidpico_w-v1.X.uf2` for regular green rp2040 PicoW boards.

=== Firmwares for the rp2350 Pico2
Firmware naming suited for the pico 2 always start with `usbsidpico2-` +
`usbsidpico2-v1.X.uf2` for regular green rp2350 Pico2 boards. +
`usbsidpico2-rgb-v1.X.uf2` for black clone rp2350 Pico2 boards with RGB LED onboard. +
`usbsidpico2_w-v1.X.uf2` for regular green rp2350 Pico2W boards.

=== Firmwares with Cynthcart embedded
Starting with firmware version v0.6.0-BETA firmwares ending with `_em` have an embedded emulator running Cynthcart. +
For example `usbsidpico-v1.0_em.uf2` or `usbsidpico2-rgb-v1.3_em.uf2` +
See the `USBSID-Pico-Cynthcart-manual` file for more information.

=== Firmwares with embedded USBSID-Player
Starting with firmware version v0.6.0-BETA firmwares ending with `_sp` have an embedded emulator that can play PSID and RSID tunes and PSID64 PRG/P00 files. +
For example `usbsidpico2-v1.0_sp.uf2` or `usbsidpico2-v1.3-rgb_sp.uf2` +
This USBSID-Player is still in active development and some tunes might not work or play at all. +
The embedded USBSID-Player requires more then 256KB RAM and an overclocked CPU which makes this firmware only available for rp2350 Pico2 boards. +
See the `USBSID-Player-manual` file for more information.


== How to flash your Pico
**NOTE**: +
[.underline]#When flashing a new firmware version, all previously configured settings will be reset to default. Use the commandline configtool to save your current settings to a `ini` file if you want to save them!# +
A Raspberry Pi Pico board is incredibly easy to flash, as it comes with a built in bootloader for flashing new firmwares in the `uf2` format. +
In order to flash a new firmware to your USBSID-Pico you will need to put the Pico into bootloader mode. +
This can be done in multiple ways:

With the cable already plugged into your computer and Pico and seated on the board (using buttons):

- Press and hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico.
- Press and release the `RST` button on the USBSID-Pico board.
- Now release the `BOOTSEL` button.
- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2` or `RP2350` depending on your Pico type.
- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.

With the cable not plugged in to your computer and Pico and also not seated on the board (using buttons):

- Plug in the USB cable to your Pico and not into your computer.
- While holding the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico plugin the other end of the USB cable into your computer.
- Now release the `BOOTSEL` button.
- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2` or `RP2350` depending on your Pico type.
- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.

With the cable already plugged into your computer and Pico and seated on the board (using software):

- Go to the config webpage (https://usbsid.loudai.nl/index.html?player=webusb&debug=usbsidpico):
- Connect to the board using `WebUSB (Hermit)` as emulator
- Click on `Open config`
- Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on `Bootloader` in the box marked `other`
- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2` or `RP2350` depending on your Pico type.
- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.

or

- With the CLI config tool command in your `PATH` variable
- Type `cfg_usbsid -boot` to send the reboot to bootloader command
- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2` or `RP2350` depending on your Pico type.
- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.

== Firmware configuration
USBSID-Pico has an extensive set of configuration options that expands with each firmware release. +

=== Configuration tool
You can configurate your board by using the commandline config-tool or together with the Python Configuration GUI by ISL/Samar if you prefer a GUI.

==== GUI downloads
https://github.com/LouDnl/USBSID-Pico/blob/master/examples/config-tool/cfg_usbsid_GUI.py[Download script] +
Python3 -> https://www.python.org/downloads/[Download] +
TkInter -> https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html[Installation guide] +
And either one of the Linux or Windows CLI downloads below

==== Linux / Windows downloads
The latest version of the config tool is available in a zip file called `tools.zip` from release v0.6.0-BETA and up

==== Windows downloads
If the DLL's are missing from the zip file you can always download them from here: +

=== Configuration web page (for Chrome/Edge based browsers using webusb)
https://usbsid.loudai.nl/?player=webusb&debug=usbsidpico[USBSID web configuration tool] (requires a Chrome based browser). +
If needed you can change your USBSID configuration after selecting WebUSB and clicking on `Open config`. +
image:images/firmware/usbsidpico-config-dark.png[Title=Config Dark,300]image:images/firmware/usbsidpico-config-light.png[Title=Config Light,300] +
_The player is set up with borrowed code from Deepsid using Hermit's JsSID implementation._

==== Debug functions
For additional testing there are some debug functions available on the https://usbsid.loudai.nl/?player=webusb&debug=usbsidpicoUSBSID Debug site (requires a Chrome based browser).

=== Board clock rate
The Commodore64 has different clockrates depending on where you live, USBSID-Pico supports these different clock rates as configuration setting. +
Supported SID players will automatically send a new clock rate request to the board to switch to. +
Available options are: +
`DEFAULT 1000000Hz`, `PAL 985248Hz`, `NTSC 1022727`, `DREAN 1023440`, `NTSC2 1022730`

=== Clock rate locked
Some players start sending data directly after the clockrate is changed. While in most cases this is no issue, some SID clones need some time to start up. This causes issues when the clock rate is changed on the fly. +
Also changing the clock rate multiple times after another can cause data corruption to the SID which causes garbled sound. +
To overcome this it is possible to lock the clockrate to the current setting it is set to. This blocks the ability for on the fly change requests. +
Available options are: +
`False`, `True`

=== Audio mode
_PCB revision v1.3 only_ +
Sets the audio mode for the headphone jack and audio out pins. +
When set to `Mono` the audio of both SID sockets will be combined to mono. +
When set to `Stereo` the audio of both SID sockets will be separated into left for `SID1` and right for `SID2` +
Available options are: +
`Mono`, `Stereo`

=== Socket settings
Each socket comes with its own set of configurable options.

==== Socket One/Two Enabled
Enable or disable the use of this socket. +
Available options are: +

This requires the `Chiptype` for this socket to be set to `Clone` and ofcourse a dual SID supporting SID clone with support of connecting the A5 address line. +
Available options are: +
`False`, `True`
