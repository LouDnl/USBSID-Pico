== Firmware types
image:images/firmware/logo-v1.0.jpg[Title=PCB logo v1.0]
image:images/firmware/logo-v1.3.jpg[Title=PCB logo v1.3] +
Each PCB revision is the firmware designator, please check your PCB revision, this is under the MOS logo and next to *USBSID-Pico* on your PCB. +
Firmware filenames contain the PCB revision number e.g. `usbsidpico-rgb-v1.X.uf2` is for PCB revision `v1.0` and for use with a black clone Pico containing an RGB LED.

== Firmware naming
Below are the filenames used for each Pico board type, take great care in selecting the correct file for you Pico! +
**WARNING!** Do _NOT_ use the **RGB** firmware for any of the (non black) rp2040 or rp2350 Pico boards that do not contain an RGB LED. +
The 1.X in each filename equals for the PCB revision as mentioned under firmware types. Don't worry if you use the incorrect revision, this causes no harm. +
`usbsidpico-v1.X.uf2` for Pico1 regular green rp2040 Pico boards. +
`usbsidpico-rgb-v1.X.uf2` for Pico1 black clone rp2040 Pico boards with RGB LED onboard. +
`usbsidpico_w-v1.X.uf2` for PicoW regular green rp2040 PicoW boards. +
`usbsidpico2-v1.X.uf2` for Pico2 regular green rp2350 Pico2 boards. +
`usbsidpico2_w-v1.X.uf2` for Pico2W regular green rp2350 Pico2W boards. +

== How to flash your Pico
**NOTE**: +
[.underline]#When flashing a new firmware version, all previously configured settings will be reset to default. Use the commandline configtool to save your current settings to a `ini` file if you want to save them!# +
A Raspberry Pi Pico board is incredibly easy to flash, as it comes with a built in bootloader for flashing new firmwares in the `uf2` format. +
In order to flash a new firmware to your USBSID-Pico you will need to put the Pico into bootloader mode. +
This can be done in multiple ways:

With the cable already plugged into your computer and Pico and seated on the board (using buttons):

- Press and hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico.
- Press and release the `RST` button on the USBSID-Pico board.
- Now release the `BOOTSEL` button.
- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2` or `RP2350` depending on your Pico type.
- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.

With the cable not plugged in to your computer and Pico and also not seated on the board (using buttons):

- Plug in the USB cable to your Pico and not into your computer.
- While holding the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico plugin the other end of the USB cable into your computer.
- Now release the `BOOTSEL` button.
- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2` or `RP2350` depending on your Pico type.
- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.

With the cable already plugged into your computer and Pico and seated on the board (using software):

- Go to the config webpage (https://usbsid.loudai.nl/index.html?player=webusb&debug=usbsidpico):
- Connect to the board using `WebUSB (Hermit)` as emulator
- Click on `Open config`
- Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on `Bootloader` in the box marked `other`
- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2` or `RP2350` depending on your Pico type.
- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.

or

- With the CLI config tool (linux) command in your `$PATH` variable
- Type `cfg_usbsid -boot` to send the reboot to bootloader command
- A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2` or `RP2350` depending on your Pico type.
- Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
- After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.

== Firmware configuration
USBSID-Pico has an extensive set of configuration options that expands with each firmware release. +
At this point in time you can change the settings to your liking by using the configuration webpage or the CLI config tool for linux. +
webpage: https://usbsid.loudai.nl/index.html?player=webusb&debug=usbsidpico +

=== Default configuration
Each firmware version comes with the same default configuration. +
An explanation for these settings can be found further on in this document. +

=== Board clock rate
The Commodore64 has different clockrates depending on where you live, USBSID-Pico supports these different clock rates as configuration setting. +
Supported SID players will automatically send a new clock rate request to the board to switch to. +
Available options are: +
`DEFAULT 1000000Hz`, `PAL 985248Hz`, `NTSC 1022727`, `DREAN 1023440`, `NTSC2 1022730`

=== Clock rate locked
Some players start sending data directly after the clockrate is changed. While in most cases this is no issue, some SID clones need some time to start up. This causes issues when the clock rate is changed on the fly. +
Also changing the clock rate multiple times after another can cause data corruption to the SID which causes garbled sound. +
To overcome this it is possible to lock the clockrate to the current setting it is set to. This blocks the ability for on the fly change requests. +
Available options are: +
`False`, `True`

=== Audio mode
_PCB revision v1.3 only_ +
Sets the audio mode for the headphone jack and audio out pins. +
When set to `Mono` the audio of both SID sockets will be combined to mono. +
When set to `Stereo` the audio of both SID sockets will be separated into left for `SID1` and right for `SID2` +
Available options are: +
`Mono`, `Stereo`
