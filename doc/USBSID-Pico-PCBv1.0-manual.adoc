1. 12 volt or 9 volt selection jumper +
  image:images/v1.0/voltage-jumper-smaller.png[title=Voltage jumper]
  - open = for 6581 SID only!! (12 volts)
  - closed = for 8580 SID (9 volts)
2. Socket 2 6581 / 8580 SID type selection jumpers +
  image:images/v1.0/SID2-jumper-smaller.png[title=SID2 selection jumper]
  - both closed left = 6581
  - both closed right = 8580
3. Socket 1 6581 / 8580 SID type selection jumpers +
  image:images/v1.0/SID1-jumper-smaller.png[title=SID1 selection jumper]
  - both closed left = 6581
  - both closed right = 8580
4. Audio channel selection jumper +
  image:images/v1.0/audio-jumper-smaller.png[title=Audio jumper]
  - closed on Socket 1 side = left & right channel for socket 1
  - closed on Socket 2 side = left channel for socket 2 & right channel for socket 1
5. Address line A5 for adressess above $1F (SKPico 2nd SID for example) +
  image:images/v1.0/A5-pins-smaller.png[title=Address 5 pins]
  - both pins are routed to the same GPIO for using adresses higher then $20
6. Uart debugging output port +
  image:images/v1.0/uart-port-smaller.png[title=UART port]
  - TX on the right
  - RX on the left
7. Optional 330k pulldown resistor hooked up to EXT-IN for 8580 filter bypass in socket 2 +
  image:images/v1.0/SID2-extin-bypass-smaller.png[title=EXTIN bypass]
  - solder closed = enabled
8. Optional 330k pulldown resistor hooked up to EXT-IN for 8580 filter bypass in socket 1 +
  image:images/v1.0/SID1-extin-bypass-smaller.png[title=EXTIN bypass]
  - solder pad closed = enabled
9. Optional 1MHz crystal socket (not included in BOM) +
  image:images/v1.0/optional-crystal-smaller.png[title=Optional Crystal]
  - solder pad closed = enabled (when a crystal is socketed)
  - this disables the internal clock generation on the Pico
10. Optional 1k resistor for 6581 SID in socket 2 +
  - **ATTENTION!**: _This solder pad label is incorrect, it should read 6581!_ +
  image:images/v1.0/SID2-audio-solderjumper-smaller.png[title=6581 jumper]
  - solder pad closed = enabled
11. Optional 1k resistor for 6581 SID in socket 2 +
  - **ATTENTION!**: _This solder pad label is incorrect, it should read 6581!_ +
  image:images/v1.0/SID1-audio-solderjumper-smaller.png[title=6581 jumper]
  - solder pad closed = enabled
12. Socket 2 audio out via dupont connector +
  image:images/v1.0/audio-out-smaller.png[title=Audio out]
  - Ground and S2 as labeled
13. Socket 1 audio out via dupont connector +
  image:images/v1.0/audio-out-smaller.png[title=Audio out]
  - Ground and S1 as labeled
14. Reset button +
