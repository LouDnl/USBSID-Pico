== Linux Udev rules
In the [examples/udev](repo/examples/udev-rules/69-usbsid-permissions.rules) directory you can find the udev rules that I use on Linux. This purely an example file that you can use and change to your own needs.
Steps required for this to work
[source,shell]
----
  # Check if you are in the plugdev group
  groups  # should show the plugdev group
  # Copy the udev ules file to the correct directory
  sudo cp 69-usbsid-permissions.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
  # Now reload the udev rules
  udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
  # Not working? Try reloading the service
  sudo systemctl restart udev
----

== Windows driver
Use [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) to install the correct driver for USBSID-Pico.

== Firmware
See the [firmware changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on what's changed and previous releases. +
=== Firmware versions +
Use `usbsidpico.uf2` for Pico1 regular green rp2040 Pico boards.
Use `usbsidpico-rgb.uf2` for Pico1 black clone rp2040 Pico boards with RGB LED onboard.
Use `usbsidpico_w.uf2` for PicoW regular green rp2040 PicoW boards.
Use `usbsidpico2.uf2` for Pico2 regular green rp2350 Pico2 boards.
Use `usbsidpico2_w.uf2` for Pico2W regular green rp2350 Pico2W boards.
**WARNING!** Do _NOT_ use the RGB firmware for any of the (non black) rp2040 or rp2350 Pico boards that do not contain an RGB LED.
=== How to flash
A Raspberry Pi Pico board is incredibly easy to flash, as it comes with a built in bootloader for flashing new firmwares in the `uf2` format.
In order to flash a new firmware to your USBSID-Pico you will need to put the Pico into bootloader mode. This can be done in 2 ways:
1. While the Pico is seated on the USBSID-Pico board and with the USB cable plugged into your computer and the Pico do the following:
  - Press and hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico.
  - Press and release the `RST` button on the USBSID-Pico board.
  - Now release the `BOOTSEL` button.
  - A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2`.
  - Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
  - After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.
2. When flashing a Pico that is not seated on the board do the following:
  - Plug in the USB cable to your Pico and not into your computer.
  - While holding the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico plugin the other end of the USB cable into your computer.
  - Now release the `BOOTSEL` button.
  - A new drive should appear on your computer called `RPI-RP2`.
  - Copy the correct `uf2` firmware file to this directory.
  - After copying the Pico will reboot and your Pico is flashed.
=== Firmware features
The firmware is still in development so features might change, be added or removed.
- By default both sockets are enabled and the configuration is set to 2 SID's.
- Custom CDC protocol for playing SID files or usage with emulators
- WebUSB support using the same CDC protocol for WebUSB supporting players
  - Play SID files in your browser via [Deepsid](https://deepsid.chordian.net/) by Chordian
  - Play SID files in your browser via [C64jukebox](https://haendel.ddns.net:8443/static/c64jukebox.vue) by Kenchis
- Midi (in) ASID support (heavily inspired by multiple sources)
  - Play SID files in your (midi supporting) browser via [Deepsid](https://deepsid.chordian.net/) by Chordian
  - Play SID files in your (midi supporting) browser via [IneSID](https://inesid.fazibear.me/) by Fazibear
- Midi device support over USB
  - Use your USBSID-Pico as Synth with your Midi controller
- Two SID sockets with up to 4 SID's (e.g. SKPico) supported
  - Socket one address range $00 ~ $7F (default $00 ~ $1F) auto based on configuration settings
  - Socket two address range $00 ~ $7F (default $40 ~ $7F) auto based on configuration settings
  - Configurable via [config-tool](repo/examples/config-tool) for Linux (Windows still in development)
- Onboard LED acts as VU meter calculated by the voices of SID1 (Pico & Pico2 only)
- Onboard RGB LED acts as second VU meter calculated by the voices of SID1 (default)
  - Requires Black Pico clone board with RGB LED onboard!
  - SID voices to use for calculation can be changed in config
- Uses the [TinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) stack
=== ISSUES that need addressing (Any help is welcome)
* Digiplay is better in Vice then SidplayFp at the moment.
  While not yet at 100%, most tunes will play!
  See the [discussion](https://github.com/LouDnl/USBSID-Pico/discussions/1) about this.
=== Building
You can build the firmware using the Pico SDK 2.1.0 and the included TinyUSB. Be sure to clone the SDK with `--recurse-submodules`.
After download run `cd pico-sdk/lib/tinyusb` and then `python3 tools/get_deps.py PICO_PLATFORM` where PICO_PLATFORM is either rp2040 or rp2350 depending on the board you are using.

=== Schematic and BOM
If you want and are up to it you can create your own development board by using the provided [schematic](resources/v1.0-schematic.pdf) and [interactive BOM](https://loudnl.github.io/).
=== PCB Features ~ v1.0
- Supports all MOS SID chips e.g. MOS6581, MOS6582 & MOS8580
- Supports SID chip replacements e.g. [SIDKick-Pico](https://github.com/frntc/SIDKick-pico), [SwinSID](https://github.com/dmantione/swinsid), ARMSID (untested), FPGASID (untested)
- 1 MHz oscillator (external optional, enabled via jumper pad)
  - if no external clock is detected USBSID-Pico will generate a 1 MHz square wave using pio
    - clock speed is configurable
  - if an external clock is detected will read the external clock signal
- Power via USB
  - 5v stepup for clean 5v VCC to both SID chips
  - 12v or 9v stepup for clean VDD to both SID chips
    - 12v/9v jumper, defautls to 12v ~ inspired by [SIDBlaster-Nano](https://codeberg.org/CBMretro/SIDBlaster-USB_Nano) design
- Audio out filter as in the [C64 schematics](https://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/computers/c64/250469-rev.A-right.gif)
  - With optional 6581 resistor, solder the 6581 (mislabeled 8580!) jumper pad in each audio circuit for this.
- Audio jumper
  - SID1 audio left & right
  - SID1 audio left & SID2 audio right
- Optional EXT-IN pulldown resistor as filter bypass to reduce filter noise for Digiplay on 8580 SID's
